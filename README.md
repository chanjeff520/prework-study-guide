## Description

The Prework Study Application is use to help the students learn some of the concepts that will be taught in the bootcamp and also give the student a head start for the bootcamp.
I did not build this project. This was a homework assignment.
During this project, we learn how to use some functions of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The goal is to fimilarize the systems that we will be using for the bootcamp, so we do not fall behind during the first week.
